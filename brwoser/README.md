<h2 align="center">üåê Most private browsers</h2>

A constantly updated guide to the best private browser (not to be confused with anonymous as well as secure, this repository has other goals)

As a reminder, anonymity is more affected by other factors than your browser. Tor or VPN will be much more effective than even the most properly configured browser without cookies 

The concept of browser fingerprinting, which is often used as an excuse to use a corporate browser in stock configuration, is largely a lost cause and therefore can not practically be taken into consideration when choosing a browser. The argument for fingerprinting is that by using an obscure or lesser-used browser with unusual capabilities (ie has uMatrix, uBlock installed, or is using Netsurf), your fingerprint becomes unique and therefore easy to track. This becomes less of a good thing to base your decision off of when you consider what it would take to make yourself un-fingerprintable (an unachievable misnomer), and how that would make your overall privacy, security and anonymity worse than if you had just used a far more basic browser, devoid of vulnerable features.
