## Disable Manifest v3
Manifest v3 - the main innovation is directed against extension developers and disabling the ability to interfere directly with sites and disable ads.

The company adds that these changes will be rolled out to all users in the Chrome Stable channel over the coming months, with the goal of completing the transition to the MV3 standard by the start of 2025.

Enterprises using the ExtensionManifestV2Availability policy, which enables them to control Manifest v2 extension availability on Linux, Mac, Windows, and ChromeOS, will be exempt from any browser changes until June 2025, when the Chrome MV2 deprecation enterprise rollout begins.

### Postponing the transition to Manifest V3 until June 2025
For Windows – open PowerShell as an administrator and enter the command:

```powershell
$path = "registry::HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Google\Chrome"; New-Item $path -Force; Set-ItemProperty $path -Name ExtensionManifestV2Availability -Value 2
```

For MacOS – open the Terminal application and run the command:

```bash
defaults write com.google.Chrome.plist ExtensionManifestV2Availability -int 2
```

Go to `chrome://policy/` and click "Reload policies".
