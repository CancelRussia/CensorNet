<h1 align="center">üåê Most private browsers</h1>

A constantly updated guide to the best private browser (not to be confused with anonymous as well as secure, this repository has other goals)

As a reminder, anonymity is more affected by other factors than your browser. Tor or VPN will be much more effective than even the most properly configured browser without cookies 

The concept of browser fingerprinting, which is often used as an excuse to use a corporate browser in stock configuration, is largely a lost cause and therefore can not practically be taken into consideration when choosing a browser. The argument for fingerprinting is that by using an obscure or lesser-used browser with unusual capabilities (ie has uMatrix, uBlock installed, or is using Netsurf), your fingerprint becomes unique and therefore easy to track. This becomes less of a good thing to base your decision off of when you consider what it would take to make yourself un-fingerprintable (an unachievable misnomer), and how that would make your overall privacy, security and anonymity worse than if you had just used a far more basic browser, devoid of vulnerable features.

<h2> <img src="https://i.ibb.co/jgv4K78/Chrome.png" width="25px"></img> Google Chrome</h2>

### ‚ùå $\color{red}{\textsf{EXTREMELY HIGH!}}$

Google details the extreme spyware feature it labels "Usage Statistics and Crash Reports". What it does, is it sends very detailed information about your hardware and computer usage, which confirms that it definitely contains the following spyware features:

- A tracker that records mouse input over time
- A tracker that profiles memory usage

But, it can also be extrapolated from the vague language that Chrome could and probably does monitor what other programs you have open. Either way, it is an extreme amount of information being collected, since it can be used to recreate what the user is doing on their desktop at all times. Chrome clarifies that this information is being sent **WHENEVER** a website is being "slow" or whenever Google Chrome crashes.

### Google Chrome contains a keylogger
This was confirmed in multiple places. Basically, whenever you type into the search bar, that information is sent to Google. You can apparently turn it off by opting out of the "suggestion service".

### Google Chrome records your voice
Google Chrome is confirmed to be constantly listening to any open microphones on your computer. This can be found in this statement in a privacy publication. "Voice & audio information may be collected. For example, if your child uses audio activation commands (e.g., "OK, Google" or touching the microphone icon), a recording of the following speech/audio, plus a few seconds before, will be stored to their account‚Ä¶" This feature is opt-in if you are using the "Google Accounts" spyware platform and specifically tell Google to build a profile of your child. It's unverified whether or not Google uploads information it listens too to its servers outside of this feature.

### Microsoft Edge scans the pages you visit
Microsoft‚Äôs Edge browser appears to be sending URLs you visit to its Bing API website. Reddit users first spotted the privacy issues with Edge last week, noticing that the latest version of Microsoft Edge sends a request to bingapis.com with the full URL of nearly every page you navigate to.

### The Edge scans your clipboard[^1]
[^1]: https://www.reddit.com/r/browsers/comments/12o6dje/so_ms_edge_mind_explaining_this_to_me_why_are_you/

I always open msedge (Microsoft Edge) in background to play youtube music videos, or SNS.yet, it monitor/accessing my clipboard. 

### New tab - automatic address connection
The first connection is established to the address "ntp.msn.com", where the currently set search engine (Bing) is transmitted to Microsoft as a parameter. Linked to this call is the opening of the website "www.msn.com", where various resources (JavaScript, stylesheet, images, etc.) are reloaded from sources in order to display the website in the browser[^2]

In the default configuration, the browser is a serious privacy disaster. Only after adjusting various settings, such as deactivating Defender SmartScreen, changing the search engine and the setting for "new tabs" does it become a bit more privacy-friendly. However, we are far from privacy-friendly, since the transmission of telemetry data can only be reduced during use, but not deactivated.

Microsoft Edge is probably used as the default browser in many companies and institutions. Administrators should take a close look and check the settings and group policies. In my opinion, the browser cannot be used in the default configuration.

And last but not least: Even in "private mode", Microsoft Edge sends EVERY domain or complete URL (incl. parameters) to the cloud - for security reasons. WTF Microsoft!

Let's briefly recall the marketing slogan Microsoft uses to promote the Edge browser:

<h2> <img src="https://i.ibb.co/0M4JSxx/Vivaldi.png" width="25px"></img> Vivaldi</h2>

### ‚ùå $\color{red}{\textsf{HIGH}}$
Vivaldi makes about 119 requests on startup, and continues to make unsolicited connections after. Anti-privacy Bing is the default search engine.

**EVEN IF** you disable everything under "Google Services" and "Google Extensions" under "Privacy" in settings, it will still make automatic connections to Google. Also makes connections after first start up to `mirmir.vivaldi.com` and `downloads.vivaldi.com`.

### Vivaldi Assigns you a unique ID
From the Privacy Policy: "When you install Vivaldi browser (‚ÄúVivaldi‚Äù), each installation profile is assigned a unique user ID that is stored on your computer. Vivaldi will send a message using HTTPS directly to our servers located in Iceland every 24 hours containing this ID, version, cpu architecture, screen resolution and time since last message. We anonymize the IP address of Vivaldi users by removing the last octet of the IP address from your Vivaldi client then we store the resolved approximate location after using a local geoip lookup. The purpose of this collection is to determine the total number of active users and their geographical distribution".

### Some users claim that Vivaldi is a keylogger
Convenient and functional browser. But spyshelter periodically showed me messages that Vivaldi was trying to register keystrokes (in essence, this is keylogging), and I created a rule forbidding the browser to do this. Once a day he makes an attempt, but spyshelter blocks this action. It is worth saying that periodically Firefox also registers keystrokes, while spyshelter automatically resolves this action. But it's about Vivaldi. Today, after updating the browser to the latest version, spyshelter displayed a message to me that it had not previously displayed. It concerned Vivaldi, who was trying to access BITS interprocess communication, if I write correctly. I didn‚Äôt particularly read and allowed this action, because when I blocked the browser began to crash. However, I‚Äôm interested in WHAT the browser did, because judging by the spyshelter log, the browser used some kind of utility to copy files from the hard disk or something like that. Recently I found a video where it was said that Vivaldi spies and once a day sends somewhere all the information about user sessions per day, using a unique identifier that is assigned to each user. I don‚Äôt know how true this is, and if it‚Äôs true, how much detailed information he sends, and whether other browsers do it. Now I‚Äôm wondering WHAT is the spyshelter logged for the browser action?[^3}
