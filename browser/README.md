<h1 align="center">üåê Most private browsers</h1>

A constantly updated guide to the best private browser (not to be confused with anonymous as well as secure, this repository has other goals)

As a reminder, anonymity is more affected by other factors than your browser. Tor or VPN will be much more effective than even the most properly configured browser without cookies 

The concept of browser fingerprinting, which is often used as an excuse to use a corporate browser in stock configuration, is largely a lost cause and therefore can not practically be taken into consideration when choosing a browser. The argument for fingerprinting is that by using an obscure or lesser-used browser with unusual capabilities (ie has uMatrix, uBlock installed, or is using Netsurf), your fingerprint becomes unique and therefore easy to track. This becomes less of a good thing to base your decision off of when you consider what it would take to make yourself un-fingerprintable (an unachievable misnomer), and how that would make your overall privacy, security and anonymity worse than if you had just used a far more basic browser, devoid of vulnerable features.

Google details the extreme spyware feature it labels "Usage Statistics and Crash Reports". What it does, is it sends very detailed information about your hardware and computer usage, which confirms that it definitely contains the following spyware features:

- A tracker that records mouse input over time
- A tracker that profiles memory usage

But, it can also be extrapolated from the vague language that Chrome could and probably does monitor what other programs you have open. Either way, it is an extreme amount of information being collected, since it can be used to recreate what the user is doing on their desktop at all times. Chrome clarifies that this information is being sent **WHENEVER** a website is being "slow" or whenever Google Chrome crashes.

### Google Chrome contains a keylogger
This was confirmed in multiple places. Basically, whenever you type into the search bar, that information is sent to Google. You can apparently turn it off by opting out of the "suggestion service".

### Google Chrome records your voice
Google Chrome is confirmed to be constantly listening to any open microphones on your computer. This can be found in this statement in a privacy publication. "Voice & audio information may be collected. For example, if your child uses audio activation commands (e.g., "OK, Google" or touching the microphone icon), a recording of the following speech/audio, plus a few seconds before, will be stored to their account‚Ä¶" This feature is opt-in if you are using the "Google Accounts" spyware platform and specifically tell Google to build a profile of your child. It's unverified whether or not Google uploads information it listens too to its servers outside of this feature.

### Microsoft Edge scans the pages you visit
Microsoft‚Äôs Edge browser appears to be sending URLs you visit to its Bing API website. Reddit users first spotted the privacy issues with Edge last week, noticing that the latest version of Microsoft Edge sends a request to bingapis.com with the full URL of nearly every page you navigate to.
